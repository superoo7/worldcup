It will be the 21st edition of the world's biggest football competition.World Cup history has stretched long, since 1930. At that time football has been contested at the Olympics since 1920 and won by Belgium. Uruguay then won the next two editions, namely in 1924 and 1928.\nThe success of the Olympic football tournament spurred the hope of world football's governing body (FlFA) to be able to hold its own world championship. The questionnaire is then sent to the members association, asking if they agree to organize the tournament.A special committee was formed for election purposes. FIFA President Jules Rimet became the driving force. He is assisted by the tireless secretary general, Henri Delaunay.The FIFA Congress in Amsterdam on May 28, 1928 finally decided to organize a world championship organized by FIFA. Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Sweden volunteered to host.\nUruguay finally elected. The country is considered eligible to host the Olympic champion twice and is currently celebrating the 100th anniversary of independence. Uruguay is also willing to bear all costs, including travel and accommodation from participating teams.The first World Cup was full of thorns and thorns. Europe is in the midst of an economic crisis. Participating countries only involve long sea travel, many clubs also object to releasing their best players for two months.\nAs a result, many countries decide to cancel. Rimet also has to do a lot of maneuvers to make sure there are at least four European teams - France, Belgium, Romania, and Yugoslavia - still performing.Thirteen teams (seven from South America, four from Europe, and two from North America) participated in the tournament. The first World Cup opened at the new Estadio Centenario in Montevideo on July 18, 1930. The tournament was held in three cities.\nThe participating teams were then divided into four groups, with the winners from each group progressing to the semi-finals. The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by France and the United States, which beat Mexico 4-1 and Belgium 3-0.France's Lucien Laurent scored the first goal in World Cup history. While American goalkeeper Jimmy Douglas recorded the first clean sheet (not conceded) in the tournament.\nArgentina, Uruguay, the United States and Yugoslavia won their respective groups and managed to qualify for the semi-finals. In the final, Uruguay meet Argentina. The favored Uruguayan host at the start finally won with a 4-2 win. The last match in Centenario, Montevideo, witnessed 93 thousand.\nThe first World Cup was a success, but Uruguay were disappointed as there were only four European teams participating. Anger in Montevideo was so great that four years later, when Italy hosted, Uruguay became the first and only defending champion to refuse to defend the title.In 1930 World Cup Guillermo Stabile from Argentina was the top scorer, with a collection of 8 goals.

Имена команд должны быть на английском языке:\nВы должны сделать сообщение с вашим прогнозом.

Both won the world's best player title five times. Now both are starting to get out of the way - Ronaldo and Messi are 30 years old - 30 years old - although their looks have not shown any signs of sagging.\n\nWho's the second successor? According to the football world governing body (FIFA) report, there are at least five names worth mentioning:\n\n<center>![21.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZkEXMVoCdKv5CuFRihP7vdVWgLYCSfpwjBj7pQCachdg/21.jpg)</center>\n<center> Neymar (Brasil)</center>\nHe is a classy striker who holds the status of the most expensive player in the world. Even so the backbone of Barcelona, now peddling the Paris Saint-Germain front line. Later he is also rumored to be joining Real Madrid, the club Ronaldo.\n\nHe is only 26 years old so has the opportunity to enjoy kemashuran as the most prominent players when Messi and Ronaldo began to fade. He has a complete capital: basketball grinder, game reading intelligence, and exceptional final resolution capabilities. He is now a mainstay Brazilian who fought for World Cup champion 2018.\n\n\n<center>![22.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQRg9NydfqdRvbeTDzwsAWfhumSBmYyyfAc4g4sxWeW8B/22.jpg)</center>\n<center>Mohamed Salah (Mesir)</center>\nHis name did not sound much last season. But, this season, Mohamed Salah darts like a meteor. The 28-year-old has donated 44 goals for Liverpool, bringing the team through to the Champions League next season and reaching the Champions League final this season. In that last game too - when Liverpool beat Real Madrid - he suffered a shoulder injury. Now the winger is still racing to recover in order to strengthen Egypt in the 2018 World Cup.\n\n\n<center>![23.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmYUXKkraWBBiKG1whMmNgvwJKfAxT1fe2TKaXdqsvf6Dc/23.jpg)</center>\n<center>Kevin de Bruyne (Belgia)</center>\nThis season, Kevin de Bruyne won the ass kings title from another Belgian player, Eden Hazard.

He is a hard worker in the field, has a tremendous instinct in finding space and time to score goals. He is a mainstay of Tottenham and England national team. In the national team he has even been believed to be a captain. After Messi and Ronaldo decline, Kane is likely to become Neymar's top competitor in the title race of the world's best players. Especially if he can move to a club that is more likely champion at the level of domestic and Europe.\n\n<center>![25.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmRB8SD7gTTQA9US9av79syvZDLmvjRtJv7mhvz3VngcDL/25.jpg)</center>\n<center>Kylian Mbappe (Prancis)</center>\n\nIn the age of 19 years, he was able to compete with another big name.

Madrid reportedly submitted a new contract for striker Cristiano Ronaldo. However, the offer of Real Madrid is considered not satisfy the mega star.\nMadrid called the new contract for a fee of 28.5 million pounds, or about Rp 529.7 billion per year. But the value is still below the salary of his arch-enemy, Lionel Messi, who paid from Barcelona for 31.2 million pounds, or about Rp 579.9 billion per year.\nAccording to Spanish journalist Manolo Lama, Real Madrid also split Ronaldo's salary. A total of 22 million pounds is a basic salary while 6.5 million pounds in the form of bonuses if he won the Champions League, Spanish League, Copa del Rey and so forth.\n\n<center>![6.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmS5VFKp5syQSBuejkN2tfRpQqZe8zFfaMRK4KDDinVoER/6.jpg)</center>\n\nReal Madrid's offer did not fully satisfy Ronaldo. He considers himself worth more than Messi who is currently the highest paid footballer in the world.\nTherefore, there is no news that Cristiano Ronaldo will soon sign a new contract at Real Madrid. The process of negotiation between the two sides is called sustainable. But Ronaldo mentioned will soon take decisions after the 2018 World Cup.\n\n![WorldCup-Contest-2018.gif](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdR5h248eo3vteRUjMGCoDVRa7rBjyBLeWKf59DfRKF8o/WorldCup-Contest-2018.gif)\n\nA football world-cup prediction contest has been organised by @blocktrades, @acidyo and @anomadsoul and this is my entry to the contest.\n\nScore | Team | | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\nL| Russia | vs | Saudi Arabia | W\nL | Egypt | vs | Uruguay | W\nW| Morocco | vs | Iran | L\nT | Portugal | vs | Spain |T\nW | France | vs | Australia | L\nW | Argentina | vs | Iceland | L\nL | Peru | vs | Denmark | W\nT | Croatia | vs | Nigeria | T\nT | Costa Rica | vs | Serbia | T\nW | Germany | vs | Mexico | L\nW |Brazil | vs | Switzerland | L\nL |Sweden | vs | South Korea | W\nT | Belgium | vs | Panama | T\nL | Tunisia | vs | England | W\nT | Poland | vs | Senegal | T\nL | Colombia | vs | Japan | W\nW | Russia | vs | Egypt | L\nW | Portugal | vs | Morocco | L\nL | Uruguay | vs | Saudi Arabia | W\nL | Iran | vs | Spain | W\nW | France | vs | Peru | L\nW | Denmark | vs | Australia | L\nL | Argentina | vs | Croatia | W\nW | Brazil | vs | Costa Rica | L\nT | Nigeria | vs | Iceland | T\nT | Serbia | vs | Switzerland | T\nT | Belgium | vs | Tunisia | T\nW | Germany | vs | Sweden | L\nL | South Korea | vs | Mexico | W\nW | England | vs | Panama | L\nT | Japan | vs | Senegal | T\nT | Poland | vs | Colombia | T\nW | Uruguay | vs | Russia | L\nT | Saudi Arabia | vs | Egypt | T\nW | Spain | vs | Morocco | L\nL | Iran | vs | Portugal | W\nT | Denmark | vs | France | T\nW | Australia | vs | Peru | L\nL | Nigeria | vs | Argentina | W\nT | Iceland | vs | Croatia | T\nL | South Korea | vs | Germany | W\nT | Mexico | vs | Sweden | T\nL | Serbia | vs | Brazil | W\nT | Switzerland | vs | Costa Rica | T\nL | Japan | vs | Poland | W\nT | Senegal | vs | Colombia | T\nW | England | vs | Belgium | L\nT | Panama | vs | Tunisia | T\n\n## We are organizing a Contest with a 2,000 SBD prize pool.

He accused Real Madrid of being behind the rise of the case.\nIn an interview with Spanish media Sport, Messi mentioned that the last few seasons are very difficult for him. The reason he got a massive attack from the Spanish tax authorities. He also accused Real Madrid of being behind the attack.\n\n<center>![20.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmb6Tb4NB5W8kdsAMWg3Q95dfPoAZbDSdrL6cn31qysuum/20.jpg)</center>\n\n\"I've been through tough times, like everything related to the tax office, it's very difficult because of the way they attacked me and talked about me, my family, my father and the people behind me,\" he said.\n\"I felt the attack came from Real Madri and it was very difficult, I felt really diseratng but I was lucky to have the support of those close to me, Barcelona, ​​Catalunya and journalists here.That makes me a little more calm, he continued.\nLionel Messi is accused of not reporting his earnings of 10.2 million euros from the sale of his image rights in 2007 to 2009 then. Of that value, he called not paying 4.1 million euros taxes to the Spanish tax service.\nNot only Lionel Messi, his father, Jorge Horacio Messi, was also accused of being involved in the case. Barcelona court finally convicted on Messi in June 2016 ago. His attempts to file an appeal until the appeal failed after the Spanish Supreme Court upheld the court's decision.\nLionel Messi's allegations to Real Madrid are quite plausible because after his case rolled out, a number of other Barcelona players were involved in a tax-hooked case. Defender Javier Mascherano, Dani Alves, to Neymar Jr. there are among them.\nBut recently a number of Real Madrid players are also involved in tax cases. Cristiano Ronaldo, Luka Modric, until Xabi Alonso was caught in the same case.\n\n<center>![WorldCup-Contest-2018.gif](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdR5h248eo3vteRUjMGCoDVRa7rBjyBLeWKf59DfRKF8o/WorldCup-Contest-2018.gif)</center>\n\nA football world-cup prediction contest has been organised by @blocktrades, @acidyo and @anomadsoul and this is my entry to the contest.\n\nScore | Team | | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\nL| Russia | vs | Saudi Arabia | W\nL | Egypt | vs | Uruguay | W\nW| Morocco | vs | Iran | L\nT | Portugal | vs | Spain |T\nW | France | vs | Australia | L\nW | Argentina | vs | Iceland | L\nL | Peru | vs | Denmark | W\nT | Croatia | vs | Nigeria | T\nT | Costa Rica | vs | Serbia | T\nW | Germany | vs | Mexico | L\nW |Brazil | vs | Switzerland | L\nL |Sweden | vs | South Korea | W\nT | Belgium | vs | Panama | T\nL | Tunisia | vs | England | W\nT | Poland | vs | Senegal | T\nL | Colombia | vs | Japan | W\nW | Russia | vs | Egypt | L\nW | Portugal | vs | Morocco | L\nL | Uruguay | vs | Saudi Arabia | W\nL | Iran | vs | Spain | W\nW | France | vs | Peru | L\nW | Denmark | vs | Australia | L\nL | Argentina | vs | Croatia | W\nW | Brazil | vs | Costa Rica | L\nT | Nigeria | vs | Iceland | T\nT | Serbia | vs | Switzerland | T\nT | Belgium | vs | Tunisia | T\nW | Germany | vs | Sweden | L\nL | South Korea | vs | Mexico | W\nW | England | vs | Panama | L\nT | Japan | vs | Senegal | T\nT | Poland | vs | Colombia | T\nW | Uruguay | vs | Russia | L\nT | Saudi Arabia | vs | Egypt | T\nW | Spain | vs | Morocco | L\nL | Iran | vs | Portugal | W\nT | Denmark | vs | France | T\nW | Australia | vs | Peru | L\nL | Nigeria | vs | Argentina | W\nT | Iceland | vs | Croatia | T\nL | South Korea | vs | Germany | W\nT | Mexico | vs | Sweden | T\nL | Serbia | vs | Brazil | W\nT | Switzerland | vs | Costa Rica | T\nL | Japan | vs | Poland | W\nT | Senegal | vs | Colombia | T\nW | England | vs | Belgium | L\nT | Panama | vs | Tunisia | T\n\n# We are organizing a Contest with a 2,000 SBD prize pool.

It will be the 21st edition of the world's biggest football competition.World Cup history has stretched long, since 1930. At that time football has been contested at the Olympics since 1920 and won by Belgium. Uruguay then won the next two editions, namely in 1924 and 1928.\nThe success of the Olympic football tournament spurred the hope of world football's governing body (FlFA) to be able to hold its own world championship. The questionnaire is then sent to the members association, asking if they agree to organize the tournament.A special committee was formed for election purposes. FIFA President Jules Rimet became the driving force. He is assisted by the tireless secretary general, Henri Delaunay.The FIFA Congress in Amsterdam on May 28, 1928 finally decided to organize a world championship organized by FIFA. Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Sweden volunteered to host.\nUruguay finally elected. The country is considered eligible to host the Olympic champion twice and is currently celebrating the 100th anniversary of independence. Uruguay is also willing to bear all costs, including travel and accommodation from participating teams.The first World Cup was full of thorns and thorns. Europe is in the midst of an economic crisis. Participating countries only involve long sea travel, many clubs also object to releasing their best players for two months.\nAs a result, many countries decide to cancel. Rimet also has to do a lot of maneuvers to make sure there are at least four European teams - France, Belgium, Romania, and Yugoslavia - still performing.Thirteen teams (seven from South America, four from Europe, and two from North America) participated in the tournament. The first World Cup opened at the new Estadio Centenario in Montevideo on July 18, 1930. The tournament was held in three cities.\nThe participating teams were then divided into four groups, with the winners from each group progressing to the semi-finals. The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by France and the United States, which beat Mexico 4-1 and Belgium 3-0.France's Lucien Laurent scored the first goal in World Cup history. While American goalkeeper Jimmy Douglas recorded the first clean sheet (not conceded) in the tournament.\nArgentina, Uruguay, the United States and Yugoslavia won their respective groups and managed to qualify for the semi-finals. In the final, Uruguay meet Argentina. The favored Uruguayan host at the start finally won with a 4-2 win. The last match in Centenario, Montevideo, witnessed 93 thousand.\nThe first World Cup was a success, but Uruguay were disappointed as there were only four European teams participating. Anger in Montevideo was so great that four years later, when Italy hosted, Uruguay became the first and only defending champion to refuse to defend the title.In 1930 World Cup Guillermo Stabile from Argentina was the top scorer, with a collection of 8 goals. In 18 games it created a total of 70 goals. While the total audience reached 590 thousand or an average of 32 thousand per game.\n\n<center>![b9.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQ8zd9mk7nKGqHZH7iwfZ6nyNRDZAAU18uUsw5FyLJrr2/b9.jpg)</center>\n\n<center>![b10.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbSt6kktnqnVHrks8fn3b4jL7XbaDmf9sd22QFcEirPuE/b10.jpg)</center>\n<center></center>\n\n\nThe letters you use in your game prediction should be W, L and T (To win, lose, and bind).\n\nScore | Team | | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\nL| Russia | vs | Saudi Arabia | W\nL | Egypt | vs | Uruguay | W\nW| Morocco | vs | Iran | L\nT | Portugal | vs | Spain |T\nW | France | vs | Australia | L\nW | Argentina | vs | Iceland | L\nL | Peru | vs | Denmark | W\nT | Croatia | vs | Nigeria | T\nT | Costa Rica | vs | Serbia | T\nW | Germany | vs | Mexico | L\nW |Brazil | vs | Switzerland | L\nL |Sweden | vs | South Korea | W\nT | Belgium | vs | Panama | T\nL | Tunisia | vs | England | W\nT | Poland | vs | Senegal | T\nL | Colombia | vs | Japan | W\nW | Russia | vs | Egypt | L\nW | Portugal | vs | Morocco | L\nL | Uruguay | vs | Saudi Arabia | W\nL | Iran | vs | Spain | W\nW | France | vs | Peru | L\nW | Denmark | vs | Australia | L\nL | Argentina | vs | Croatia | W\nW | Brazil | vs | Costa Rica | L\nT | Nigeria | vs | Iceland | T\nT | Serbia | vs | Switzerland | T\nT | Belgium | vs | Tunisia | T\nW | Germany | vs | Sweden | L\nL | South Korea | vs | Mexico | W\nW | England | vs | Panama | L\nT | Japan | vs | Senegal | T\nT | Poland | vs | Colombia | T\nW | Uruguay | vs | Russia | L\nT | Saudi Arabia | vs | Egypt | T\nW | Spain | vs | Morocco | L\nL | Iran | vs | Portugal | W\nT | Denmark | vs | France | T\nW | Australia | vs | Peru | L\nL | Nigeria | vs | Argentina | W\nT | Iceland | vs | Croatia | T\nL | South Korea | vs | Germany | W\nT | Mexico | vs | Sweden | T\nL | Serbia | vs | Brazil | W\nT | Switzerland | vs | Costa Rica | T\nL | Japan | vs | Poland | W\nT | Senegal | vs | Colombia | T\nW | England | vs | Belgium | L\nT | Panama | vs | Tunisia | T\n## We are organizing a Contest with a 2,000 SBD prize pool.

This is related to the decision of the IOC, the Olympic organizer to eliminate the sport of football at the 1932 Olympics in the United States, due to the low popularity of football in America. FIFA president at the time, Jules Rimet immediately set up a new competition system given the FIFA World Cup or FIFA World Cup.\n\n<center>![s1.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQYmhsTkYbCgvtk7yATQi8qKxpZjk3LNxrHjXxy9NKqAX/s1.jpg)</center>\n# World Cup First\nUruguay was named host of the first World Cup tournament in 1930, as an unofficial world champion to win two golds in the last two Olympics.

Both won the world's best player title five times. Now both are starting to get out of the way - Ronaldo and Messi are 30 years old - 30 years old - although their looks have not shown any signs of sagging.\n\nWho's the second successor? According to the football world governing body (FIFA) report, there are at least five names worth mentioning:\n\n<center>![21.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZkEXMVoCdKv5CuFRihP7vdVWgLYCSfpwjBj7pQCachdg/21.jpg)</center>\n<center> Neymar (Brasil)</center>\nHe is a classy striker who holds the status of the most expensive player in the world. Even so the backbone of Barcelona, now peddling the Paris Saint-Germain front line. Later he is also rumored to be joining Real Madrid, the club Ronaldo.\n\nHe is only 26 years old so has the opportunity to enjoy kemashuran as the most prominent players when Messi and Ronaldo began to fade. He has a complete capital: basketball grinder, game reading intelligence, and exceptional final resolution capabilities. He is now a mainstay Brazilian who fought for World Cup champion 2018.\n\n\n<center>![22.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQRg9NydfqdRvbeTDzwsAWfhumSBmYyyfAc4g4sxWeW8B/22.jpg)</center>\n<center>Mohamed Salah (Mesir)</center>\nHis name did not sound much last season. But, this season, Mohamed Salah darts like a meteor. The 28-year-old has donated 44 goals for Liverpool, bringing the team through to the Champions League next season and reaching the Champions League final this season. In that last game too - when Liverpool beat Real Madrid - he suffered a shoulder injury. Now the winger is still racing to recover in order to strengthen Egypt in the 2018 World Cup.\n\n\n<center>![23.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmYUXKkraWBBiKG1whMmNgvwJKfAxT1fe2TKaXdqsvf6Dc/23.jpg)</center>\n<center>Kevin de Bruyne (Belgia)</center>\nThis season, Kevin de Bruyne won the ass kings title from another Belgian player, Eden Hazard. Donations assist him to lead Manchester City into English Premier League champions. If he can lead Belgium to the 2018 World Cup champions, De Bruyne could be on the shortlist of the world's best players of the year, rivaling Ronaldo and Messi.\n\n<center>![24.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdhQgebwvF6RHkPN8gX9TvtK1MgwJ4MmDhqiwUB2cVHvm/24.jpg)</center>\n<center>Harry Kane (Inggris)</center>\n\nHarry Kane is maturing at the age of 24 years. He is a hard worker in the field, has a tremendous instinct in finding space and time to score goals. He is a mainstay of Tottenham and England national team. In the national team he has even been believed to be a captain. After Messi and Ronaldo decline, Kane is likely to become Neymar's top competitor in the title race of the world's best players. Especially if he can move to a club that is more likely champion at the level of domestic and Europe.\n\n<center>![25.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmRB8SD7gTTQA9US9av79syvZDLmvjRtJv7mhvz3VngcDL/25.jpg)</center>\n<center>Kylian Mbappe (Prancis)</center>\n\nIn the age of 19 years, he was able to compete with another big name. At a young age he was able to show his maturity in scoring goals, in Monaco last season and now at PSG. The 2018 World Cup could be the perfect stage for him in displaying his brilliance with France.\n\nScore | Team | | Team | Score\n-|-|-|-|-\nL| Russia | vs | Saudi Arabia | W\nL | Egypt | vs | Uruguay | W\nW| Morocco | vs | Iran | L\nT | Portugal | vs | Spain |T\nW | France | vs | Australia | L\nW | Argentina | vs | Iceland | L\nL | Peru | vs | Denmark | W\nT | Croatia | vs | Nigeria | T\nT | Costa Rica | vs | Serbia | T\nW | Germany | vs | Mexico | L\nW |Brazil | vs | Switzerland | L\nL |Sweden | vs | South Korea | W\nT | Belgium | vs | Panama | T\nL | Tunisia | vs | England | W\nT | Poland | vs | Senegal | T\nL | Colombia | vs | Japan | W\nW | Russia | vs | Egypt | L\nW | Portugal | vs | Morocco | L\nL | Uruguay | vs | Saudi Arabia | W\nL | Iran | vs | Spain | W\nW | France | vs | Peru | L\nW | Denmark | vs | Australia | L\nL | Argentina | vs | Croatia | W\nW | Brazil | vs | Costa Rica | L\nT | Nigeria | vs | Iceland | T\nT | Serbia | vs | Switzerland | T\nT | Belgium | vs | Tunisia | T\nW | Germany | vs | Sweden | L\nL | South Korea | vs | Mexico | W\nW | England | vs | Panama | L\nT | Japan | vs | Senegal | T\nT | Poland | vs | Colombia | T\nW | Uruguay | vs | Russia | L\nT | Saudi Arabia | vs | Egypt | T\nW | Spain | vs | Morocco | L\nL | Iran | vs | Portugal | W\nT | Denmark | vs | France | T\nW | Australia | vs | Peru | L\nL | Nigeria | vs | Argentina | W\nT | Iceland | vs | Croatia | T\nL | South Korea | vs | Germany | W\nT | Mexico | vs | Sweden | T\nL | Serbia | vs | Brazil | W\nT | Switzerland | vs | Costa Rica | T\nL | Japan | vs | Poland | W\nT | Senegal | vs | Colombia | T\nW | England | vs | Belgium | L\nT | Panama | vs | Tunisia | T\n\n## We are organizing a Contest with a 2,000 SBD prize pool.

Madrid reportedly submitted a new contract for striker Cristiano Ronaldo. However, the offer of Real Madrid is considered not satisfy the mega star.\nMadrid called the new contract for a fee of 28.5 million pounds, or about Rp 529.7 billion per year. But the value is still below the salary of his arch-enemy, Lionel Messi, who paid from Barcelona for 31.2 million pounds, or about Rp 579.9 billion per year.\nAccording to Spanish journalist Manolo Lama, Real Madrid also split Ronaldo's salary. A total of 22 million pounds is a basic salary while 6.5 million pounds in the form of bonuses if he won the Champions League, Spanish League, Copa del Rey and so forth.\n\n<center>![6.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmS5VFKp5syQSBuejkN2tfRpQqZe8zFfaMRK4KDDinVoER/6.jpg)</center>\n\nReal Madrid's offer did not fully satisfy Ronaldo. He considers himself worth more than Messi who is currently the highest paid footballer in the world.\nTherefore, there is no news that Cristiano Ronaldo will soon sign a new contract at Real Madrid.

He accused Real Madrid of being behind the rise of the case.\nIn an interview with Spanish media Sport, Messi mentioned that the last few seasons are very difficult for him. The reason he got a massive attack from the Spanish tax authorities. He also accused Real Madrid of being behind the attack.\n\n<center>![20.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmb6Tb4NB5W8kdsAMWg3Q95dfPoAZbDSdrL6cn31qysuum/20.jpg)</center>\n\n\"I've been through tough times, like everything related to the tax office, it's very difficult because of the way they attacked me and talked about me, my family, my father and the people behind me,\" he said.\n\"I felt the attack came from Real Madri and it was very difficult, I felt really diseratng but I was lucky to have the support of those close to me, Barcelona, ​​Catalunya and journalists here.That makes me a little more calm, he continued.\nLionel Messi is accused of not reporting his earnings of 10.2 million euros from the sale of his image rights in 2007 to 2009 then. Of that value, he called not paying 4.1 million euros taxes to the Spanish tax service.\nNot only Lionel Messi, his father, Jorge Horacio Messi, was also accused of being involved in the case. Barcelona court finally convicted on Messi in June 2016 ago. His attempts to file an appeal until the appeal failed after the Spanish Supreme Court upheld the court's decision.\nLionel Messi's allegations to Real Madrid are quite plausible because after his case rolled out, a number of other Barcelona players were involved in a tax-hooked case.
